# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

CENS Assets Tracker — a phone-first PWA for laboratory asset tracking (English/Korean). It is a fully client-side app: all runtime data lives in browser `localStorage` under `cens.*` keys. There is no live backend; ports 8040 / "Backend" are reserved for future API work.

## The app: LILAK UI React (`src-lilak/`)

The React/Vite app in `src-lilak/` is the ONLY frontend, delivered through the LILAK
portal. (There used to be a second, parallel vanilla PWA in `public/app.js` +
Firebase Hosting + a standalone Firebase login; it was removed — the portal is now
the single delivery path, and identity is the portal account.)

- React 19 + Vite. Root `index.html` → `src-lilak/main.jsx` → `App.jsx`. UI is built
  from the shared **`lilak-ui`** kit (`TopBar`, `Button`, `Card`, `DataTable`, `Icon`,
  theming/`applyPreset`, fonts).
- `lilak-ui` resolves via a Vite alias to a sibling checkout `../lilak_ui/src`
  (override with `LILAK_UI_PATH`). Source-distributed, not an npm package.
- `npm run build` → `dist/`. Vite copies `public/` into the build; `public/` now
  holds only shared assets (`seed-assets.js`, `hwpx-export.js`, `template.hwpx`,
  `icons/`, `manifest.webmanifest`), not a second app.

## Commands

```sh
npm run lilak:dev          # dev server, 127.0.0.1:5140
npm run lilak:dev:lan      # 0.0.0.0 (phone on same LAN)
npm run build              # vite build -> dist/
```

There is no test suite, linter, or type checker configured.

**HTTPS matters:** camera QR scanning only works over HTTPS or `localhost`. For phone
testing use `npm run lilak:dev:lan`, then open `https://<LAN-IP>:5140` (Vite serves
http; for a device-camera test behind the portal, use the portal's HTTPS entry).

## Data model

- Each **project** is one asset list. Under the portal the project IS the portal
  project (`/pp/asset_manager/<project>/`). Project data is keyed
  `cens.project.<projectId>.<assets|records|myList>`; active id `cens.currentProjectId`.
- `public/seed-assets.js` (`window.CENS_SEED_ASSETS`) is legacy seed data from the
  Google Sheets "CENS Equipment" tab. The React app does not auto-seed portal
  projects from it (new projects start empty); kept as reference data.
- **Auth is the portal account (SSO)** — the portal forwards its JWT and the app
  reads identity from it (`portalUser()`). There is no standalone/Firebase login;
  opened outside the portal the app shows a "open via the portal" notice.

## Portal integration

This service is delivered through the **LILAK Service Manager portal**
(`~/web_service/service_manager`, port 8025) — the single delivery path. The portal
serves the built React app (`dist/`) as a *managed, multi-project* service.

### How the portal runs it

The portal registers services via a manifest; this service's seed manifest lives at `service_manager/deploy/seed/asset_manager/service.json`:

```json
{ "kind": "asset", "mode": "managed",
  "start": { "cmd": "python3 -m http.server {port} --bind 0.0.0.0", "cwd": ".../asset_manager/dist" },
  "identity": { "accepts_portal_token": true, "link_by": "email" },
  "capabilities": { "multi_project": true, "import_export": false } }
```

Implications when changing the app:
- The portal runs `start.cmd` = **`sh portal-serve.sh {port}`**, which **rebuilds (`npm run build`) and then static-serves `dist/`** on the assigned port (`0.0.0.0`). So a portal **stop & start picks up source changes automatically** — no manual build needed. The rebuild is non-fatal: if npm is missing or the build fails, it falls back to serving the existing `dist/`. (`service_manager/build-all.sh` also builds it for the Docker image, where the seed manifest still serves `dist/` directly without rebuilding.)
- The dev server (`npm run lilak:dev`, port 5140) shows changes live but does **not** touch `dist/`; only a build (or a portal restart) updates what the portal serves.
- **`multi_project: true`** — each portal project is its own asset list, reached at **`/pp/asset_manager/<project>/`**. The portal injects `PORTAL_PROJECT` / `PORTAL_PROJECT_DATA` per project and, in the browser, `window.__PORTAL_BASE__ = /pp/asset_manager/<project>`.
- **`accepts_portal_token: true` (SSO)** — the portal forwards the user's portal JWT; the app reads identity from it (there is no local login).

### What the app does with that

`window.__PORTAL_BASE__` is always present in normal use: the portal project becomes the asset list and the portal SSO token (`lilak_portal_token` / `elog_token`) becomes the identity. See `PORTAL_BASE` / `portalUser()` / `ensureProjectState()` in `App.jsx`. (Opened WITHOUT a portal base, the app shows a "open via the portal" notice — `NoPortalScreen`.)

To make assets resolve under both standalone (`/`) and proxied (`/pp/<name>/<project>/`) serving, the build relies on `vite base: './'` plus a default `<base href="/">` in `index.html` that the portal overrides by injecting an earlier `<base>` tag. Don't remove either without understanding the other. (Note: per the portal's SERVICE_CONTRACT, managed services are normally API-only precisely to avoid base-path breakage; this service is a static-UI exception that works *because* of this dual-base setup.)
